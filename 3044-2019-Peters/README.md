# SAS  Studio or SAS  Enterprise Guide : What's the Best SAS Programming Interface for Me?                                                              

In some people, loyalty to an interface can run as deep as loyalty to a football team, and it’s been no different for SAS® users. The good news is that a concerted effort is underway to remove the barriers between interfaces and the differences between them so that you can just choose what you use based on where you are. Are you on a desktop? A mobile device?  In a conference room? This paper talks you through the integrated future that’s under development.  In the meantime, this paper helps you to understand what the strengths and weaknesses are of the programming interfaces today so that you can choose wisely. You also learn tips and tricks for working efficiently. The paper focuses on SAS® Studio and SAS® Enterprise Guide®, but it also touches on several of the other SAS programming interfaces that are available, including Jupyter.
